## About

The `python-eyelinkparser` module provides a framework to parse EyeLink data files in `.asc` format, that is, the format that you get after converting an `.edf` file with `edf2asc`. This module is mostly for personal use, and is not very well documented.

## Expected messages

By default, the parser assumes that particular messages are sent to the logfile. If you use different messages, you need to override functions in
`_eyelinkparser.EyeLinkParser`. This is not explained here, but you can look n the source code to see how it works.
